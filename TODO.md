# Drismify Project - TODO & Progress Summary

## Recent Progress

We've been working on fixing issues with the extension system in the Drismify ORM library. Specifically:

1. Fixed the missing `PrismaClient` export in the base-client.ts file by adding it as an alias for `DrismifyClient`
2. Enhanced the extension handling system to properly process middleware extensions
3. Improved the MockPrismaClient implementation in tests to properly handle connection status and middleware
4. Fixed all the failing tests in the extension system test suite
5. Implemented proper connection state handling for adapters during transactions
6. Improved the implementation of middleware, hook, and debug extensions

## Current Status

The test suite is now passing successfully. We've fixed the connection-related errors and properly implemented the mock adapter and connection states in the test environment. There is still work needed on the soft delete extension and more robust implementation of result extensions.

## Pending Tasks

### Critical

- [x] Complete the fixes for middleware tests in extensions.advanced.test.ts
- [x] Ensure that the adapter connection status is properly handled in mock classes
- [x] Fix the transaction extension implementation to work with the mock adapter
- [x] Complete proper implementation of the soft delete extension functionality

### Important

- [x] Implement proper handling for all extension types in the apply* functions
- [x] Complete the implementation of the result extension functionality
- [x] Improve error handling in the extension system

### Nice to Have

- [x] Add more comprehensive tests for complex extension combinations
- [x] Improve documentation for the extension system
- [ ] Create examples for common extension use cases
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for extension overhead
- [ ] Implement extension hot-reloading for development environments

## Missing Prisma ORM Functionality

### Database Support
- [ ] Add support for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Add support for MySQL/MariaDB

- [ ] Add support for SQL Server
- [ ] Add support for CockroachDB

### Query Features
- [x] Implement advanced filtering operations (contains, startsWith, endsWith, etc.)
- [x] Implement aggregation functions (sum, avg, min, max, groupBy)
- [x] Add full-text search capabilities - Implemented using SQLite FTS5
- [x] Support for JSON operations and querying
- [x] Implement nested writes for related records - Added support for create, connect, disconnect, and delete operations
- [x] Add support for field selection at query level

### Schema Features
- [x] Add support for views - Basic view parsing and schema definition support implemented
- [x] Implement composite types - Full support for composite types including parsing, schema translation, client generation, and JSON storage
- [x] Add support for composite/multi-field unique constraints
- [x] Add support for referential actions (onDelete, onUpdate) - Full support for Cascade, Restrict, SetNull, SetDefault, and NoAction
- [x] Implement cascade operations - Implemented through referential actions
- [x] Add support for database-level constraints

### Performance & Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add query caching mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize relationship fetching
- [ ] Implement database sharding support
- [ ] Add read replicas support

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Build interactive database Studio GUI
- [ ] Implement data validation layer
- [ ] Create data seeding with factories
- [ ] Add database health monitoring
- [ ] Implement visualization for database relations

## Next Phase Development

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for custom extension hooks beyond the current system
- [ ] Implement a plugin system for third-party extensions
- [ ] Create a visualization tool for active extensions and their execution order
- [ ] Develop a schema extension system to allow runtime model modifications

### Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor the extension application logic to reduce code duplication
- [ ] Improve type safety across the extension system
- [ ] Add comprehensive error reporting for extension failures
- [ ] Create a test harness specifically for extension development

### Documentation

- [ ] Write a comprehensive extension system guide

## Implementation Details

The main issues we've encountered are related to the way extensions are applied to client instances:

1. The middleware extension needs to correctly intercept and modify operations
2. Mock objects need to properly maintain connection state for testing
3. Extensions need to be able to be combined and applied in the correct order

All critical tasks have been completed. All important tasks except for transaction isolation and nesting support have also been addressed. Current focus should now be on adding proper transaction isolation and nesting support.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Implemented a robust soft delete extension that:
   - Properly handles record filtering in queries
   - Provides restore functionality
   - Allows configuration of the deleted and deletedAt field names
   - Works with all record operations (create, update, delete, etc.)

2. âœ… Enhanced the result extension system:
   - Completed calculated/computed fields implementation
   - Added support for field transformations
   - Implemented error handling for computed fields
   - Added caching for expensive computed fields
   - Added comprehensive test suite for extensions

3. âœ… Improve testing infrastructure:
   - Created dedicated test harnesses for extensions
   - Add more realistic real-world test cases
   - Test extension combinations and potential conflicts

4. âœ… Implemented nested writes functionality:
   - Added support for creating related records during parent creation/update
   - Implemented connecting existing records in to-one and to-many relationships
   - Added support for disconnecting related records
   - Implemented deleting related records during parent updates
   - Added support for many-to-many relationships with explicit join tables
   - Implemented updating join records in many-to-many relationships

5. ðŸ”² Implement remaining Prisma functionality:
   - Add support for more database providers
   - Add support for complex schema features
   - Build interactive database Studio
   - Add performance optimization features
   - âœ… Implement field selection at query level

## Architecture Considerations

For the extension system to be robust, we need to ensure:

1. Extensions cannot interfere with core functionality
2. Extension execution order is predictable and customizable
3. Performance impact is minimized, especially for critical path operations
4. Extensions can be conditionally applied based on environment or configuration
5. The API remains backward compatible as we enhance the extension system

## Prisma Compatibility Considerations

As we implement the missing Prisma features, we should focus on:

1. Maintaining API compatibility with Prisma's query structure
2. Supporting the same schema definition language and features
3. Providing equivalent or better performance compared to Prisma
4. Ensuring type safety and developer experience is comparable
5. Implementing a smooth migration path for existing Prisma projects
