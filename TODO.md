# Drismify Project - TODO & Progress Summary

## Recent Progress

We've been working on fixing issues with the extension system in the Drismify ORM library. Specifically:

1. Fixed the missing `PrismaClient` export in the base-client.ts file by adding it as an alias for `DrismifyClient`
2. Enhanced the extension handling system to properly process middleware extensions
3. Improved the MockPrismaClient implementation in tests to properly handle connection status and middleware
4. Fixed all the failing tests in the extension system test suite
5. Implemented proper connection state handling for adapters during transactions
6. Improved the implementation of middleware, hook, and debug extensions

## Current Status

The test suite is now passing successfully. We've fixed the connection-related errors and properly implemented the mock adapter and connection states in the test environment. There is still work needed on the soft delete extension and more robust implementation of result extensions.

## Pending Tasks

### Critical

- [x] Complete the fixes for middleware tests in extensions.advanced.test.ts
- [x] Ensure that the adapter connection status is properly handled in mock classes
- [x] Fix the transaction extension implementation to work with the mock adapter
- [ ] Complete proper implementation of the soft delete extension functionality

### Important

- [x] Implement proper handling for all extension types in the apply* functions
- [ ] Complete the implementation of the result extension functionality
- [ ] Improve error handling in the extension system
- [ ] Add proper transaction isolation and nesting support

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for complex extension combinations
- [ ] Improve documentation for the extension system
- [ ] Create examples for common extension use cases
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for extension overhead
- [ ] Implement extension hot-reloading for development environments

## Next Phase Development

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for custom extension hooks beyond the current system
- [ ] Implement a plugin system for third-party extensions
- [ ] Create a visualization tool for active extensions and their execution order
- [ ] Develop a schema extension system to allow runtime model modifications

### Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor the extension application logic to reduce code duplication
- [ ] Improve type safety across the extension system
- [ ] Add comprehensive error reporting for extension failures
- [ ] Create a test harness specifically for extension development

### Documentation

- [ ] Write a comprehensive extension system guide
- [ ] Create video tutorials for building custom extensions
- [ ] Document common extension patterns and anti-patterns
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all extension-related interfaces and functions

## Implementation Details

The main issues we've encountered are related to the way extensions are applied to client instances:

1. The middleware extension needs to correctly intercept and modify operations
2. Mock objects need to properly maintain connection state for testing
3. Extensions need to be able to be combined and applied in the correct order

Current focus should be on completing the soft delete extension implementation and enhancing the result extension functionality to support calculated fields and transformations.

## Next Steps

1. Implement a robust soft delete extension that:
   - Properly handles record filtering in queries
   - Provides restore functionality
   - Allows configuration of the deleted and deletedAt field names
   - Works with all record operations (create, update, delete, etc.)

2. Enhance the result extension system:
   - Complete calculated/computed fields implementation
   - Add support for field transformations
   - Implement value masking for sensitive fields
   - Add caching for expensive computed fields

3. Improve testing infrastructure:
   - Create a dedicated test harness for extensions
   - Add more realistic real-world test cases
   - Test extension combinations and potential conflicts

## Architecture Considerations

For the extension system to be robust, we need to ensure:

1. Extensions cannot interfere with core functionality
2. Extension execution order is predictable and customizable
3. Performance impact is minimized, especially for critical path operations
4. Extensions can be conditionally applied based on environment or configuration
5. The API remains backward compatible as we enhance the extension system
